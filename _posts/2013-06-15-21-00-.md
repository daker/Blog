# Infrared Remote

The IR Remote uses standard infrared signals and gives the ability to control the PTV using several buttons. All you have to do is attach the infrared cable to the output jack on your Pocket TV and you can immediately begin to use it to navigate your Pocket TV with the arrows system.
